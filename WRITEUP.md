### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
-   I will choose web app services.
- *Justify your choice*
-   In this case because the CMS app is just a test and wont be heavily used by alot of users I have decided to use a Web App service. Becuase of the lower cost it has and I do not need to have control over the OS environment. Also I do not want to invest to much of my time in developing the VM. The web app has high availability, vertical and horizontal scaling.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
If I would have needed to control more the environment like the OS or would have had to migrate something from my onpremise (local) servers than I would have probably selected a VM.
